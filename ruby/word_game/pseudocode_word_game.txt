#CREATE A WORDGAME CLASS

#Add getter methods for guesses remaining, current progress, win, and lose via attr_reader


#Create initialize method
#set guess count (make sure it’s an instance variable) to 0
#set win equal to false
#set lose equal to false


#Create method to establish relevant word
#input: string (word)
	#split word into letters (i.e. “apple” —> “a”, “p”, “p”, “l”, “e”)
	#Count number of elements in array (.length method)
		#Number of elements equates to half the guess limit instance variable (make guess limit equate to twice the number of elements)
		#Add guesses remaining variable = guess limit - guess count
		#Add current progress variable = array in which elements of word array replaced with “_”


#Create method to check for guessed letters
#input: string (letter)
	#compare input string (letter) to each of the elements in the array
		#if the input string equates (as in ==) to any of the elements in the array
			#replaced “_” with matched elements in current progress array
			#return current progress
			#save current progress
			#add 1 to the guess count
				#if all of the elements in the array have been matched and if the guesses remaining variable is greater than or equal to 0
					#win equals to true
				#if not all of the elements in the array have been matched and if the guesses remaining variable is equal to 0
					#lose equals to true
				#else
					#both win and lose still equal to false (game goes on)
		#if the input string is already labeled as a matched element
			#return existing current progress
		#else (if the input string does not match with any of the elements)
			#return existing current progress
			#add 1 to the guess count
				#if not all of the elements in the array have been matched and if the guesses remaining variable is equal to 0
					#lose equals to true
				#else
					#lose equals to false (game goes on)




#USER INTERFACE

#initiate game
	#print “Welcome to the Word-Guessing Game!”
		#add game as new instance to word game class


#set up word to guess
	#print “Player 1: Type in a word for Player 2 to guess”
		#get Player 1’s response and convert it to a string (equate it to string parameter in establish relevant word method)
		#print “Alright, Player 2 has #{guesses remaining} tries to guess your word”


#have Player 2 guess one letter at a time
#have Player 2 guessing in loop —> while win is false and lose is false
	#print “Player 2: Guess a letter that’s in Player 1’s word. Here’s your current progress: #{current progress}”
		#get Player 2’s response and convert it to a string (equate it to string parameter in check for guessed letter method)

#when Player 2 wins
#if win is true
	#print “Congrats! You guessed the correct word: #{current progress}
	#then break (exit program)

#when Player 2 loses
#if lose is true
	#print “Sorry! Guess Player 1 got you this time!”
	#then break (exit program)
