#CREATE A WORDGAME CLASS

#Add getter methods for secret word, guesses left, and underscored word via attr_reader


#Create initialize method
#input: string (word) —> get Player 1’s input word
	#count number of letters in string (.length method)
#set guesses left = twice the number of letters in string
#set underscored word variable equal to a function that takes on a method of underscoring every letter of input word
#create empty array of already guessed letters—>use to keep track of already guessed letters so that we know when Player 2 inputs a letter that he/she already input before
#create a win instance variable—>set it to false
#create a lose instance variable—>set it to false


#Create method for underscoring every letter of input word
#input: same string/word
	#substitute every letter of word with “_”


#Create method that takes letter guess from user and checks if secret word contains that letter
#input: guess letter
	#if input guess letter is already in the array of past guessed letters, leave as is (don’t reduce guesses left)
	#if secret word contains input letter guess, change the underscored word characters based on corresponding locations in secret word
	#else subtract 1 from guesses left if secret word does not contain letter guess
	#set conditions for when Player 2 wins or loses




#USER INTERFACE

#initiate game
	#print “Welcome to the Word-Guessing Game!”
	#print “Player 1: Type in a word for Player 2 to guess”
		#get Player 1’s response and convert it to a string (equate it to string/word parameter in initialize method)
		#add game as new instance to word game class and include word parameter


#get Player 2's input letter guess
#create loop until Player 2 either wins or loses
	#print "Player 2: Guess a letter in Player 1's word. Here's what you have so far: #{game.underscored_word}. And here are the letters you've guessed so far: #{game.guessed_letters}. You have #{game.guesses_left} guesses remaining"
		#get Player 2’s response and convert it to a string (equate it to string parameter in check letter method)


#when Player 2 wins
#if win is true
	"Congrats Player 2! You've guessed the right word: #{game.secret_word}. Guess you're pretty smart after all!"


#when Player 2 loses
#if lose is true
	#print "Sorry, you ran out of guesses. Guess Player 1 got you this time!"
