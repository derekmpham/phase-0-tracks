1. Display information in one table (consolidated and "trimmed up" information from both tables)

	SELECT last_five_presidents.id, last_five_presidents.name, last_five_presidents.start_year, last_five_presidents.end_year, last_five_presidents.graduate_degree, parties.name FROM last_five_presidents JOIN parties ON last_five_presidents.party_id = parties.id;


2. Update item that meets condition: if George HW Bush decides to go back to school and get a graduate degree

	UPDATE last_five_presidents SET graduate_degree="true" WHERE name="George HW Bush";

	-->table now shows that George HW Bush has a graduate degree


3. Display information from both tables using one query

	SELECT * FROM last_five_presidents, parties WHERE last_five_presidents.party_id = parties.id;


4. Display a narrower selection of columns from both tables using one query (took out president id, graduate degree)

	SELECT last_five_presidents.name, last_five_presidents.start_year, last_five_presidents.end_year, parties.name FROM last_five_presidents JOIN parties ON last_five_presidents.party_id = parties.id;


5. Delete an item that meets some condition: take out any president that doesn't have a graduate degree

	DELETE FROM last_five_presidents WHERE graduate_degree="false";

	-->table now shows last four presidents (since we took out Ronald Reagan)
