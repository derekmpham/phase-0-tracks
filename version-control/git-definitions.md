# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

(***I ADDED THESE WORDS FOR YOU ANDREW***) Version control "is a tool that allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code." This is useful, because you can easily go back to a previous working version if there is a mistake in a new version--this is especially useful for large projects.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is an aspect of version control that allows you to work off from the main version of a project without permanently changing it. You would use a branch, because if you make any mistakes, the main version of the project would remain unaffected since only your branch would have the mistakes you made.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a record of the changes you made to the repository. A good commit message is a clear and concise "title-like" description of the changes you made.


* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when two branches contain contradictory changes, and then are merged together (i.e. edit collision or removed file conflict).
