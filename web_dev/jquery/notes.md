Tackling jQuery:

1. Spend 40 minutes learning jQuery on Codecademy
2. Take 5 minute break
3. Spend 30 minutes following along the Thinkful jQuery interactive guide
4. Take 5 minute break 
5. Spend 30 minutes going over remaining jQuery details on W3Schools
6. Spend 5 minutes finding and bookmarking a good jQuery cheatsheet
7. Spend 5 minutes downloading necessary jQuery installations


Study Reflection:

I thought looking at the Thinkful jQuery interactive guide and the W3Schools jQuery tutorial were especially effective. The Thinkful guide was effective, because it dealt with an interactive single project that broadly went through different things you can do with jQuery. The W3Schools tutorial was effective, because it clarified and reiterated certain concepts that were elusive to me. The jQuery Codecademy was helpful such that it allowed me to get my feet wet, but there were moments where I felt that I did not receive enough guidance--specifically, I was stuck on two exercises for a while, not knowing what to do next.
